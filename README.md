# IFT-Developing-Security-Policy
I have added my academic project for the course : IFT 598: Developing security policy, where we created a research paper on DATA BREACH.


This course focuses on the development of security policy, risk solutions, and incident response facilities. Using the information security framework, this course identifies strategies and processes used in governance, risk management, asset management, human resources, and physical security to create, evaluate, and audit security policies
